# Web Vulnerability Scanner

A powerful and versatile web vulnerability scanner designed to find common security flaws in web applications, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, Directory Traversal, and CSRF vulnerabilities. This tool provides flexible scanning options, multithreading for faster analysis, and generates a detailed HTML report of the findings.

## Features

- **SQL Injection Detection:** Finds possible SQL injection points in URLs.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection:** Detects potential XSS vulnerabilities in web pages.
- **Command Injection Detection:** Identifies command injection vulnerabilities by injecting test commands.
- **Directory Traversal Detection:** Searches for directory traversal flaws that expose sensitive files.
- **CSRF Vulnerability Check:** Checks forms for the absence of CSRF tokens.
- **Form Submission Testing:** Automatically submits forms with malicious payloads to check for vulnerabilities.
- **Multithreading:** Speed up scans with user-defined threads.
- **Customizable Scans:** Perform targeted scans for specific vulnerabilities using command-line options.
- **HTML Report Generation:** Generates a detailed HTML report of the scan results.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Includes error handling to avoid unexpected crashes during the scanning process.
